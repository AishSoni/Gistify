## Core Features:

- Repository Summary: Summarize code in a GitHub repository using Gemini, creating a high-level overview of the repository by analyzing its documentation and code.
- Codebase Graph: Generate a relationship graph illustrating the connections between different abstractions within the codebase.
- Interactive Exploration: Interactive display of the codebase graph allowing users to delve deeper into specific abstractions for detailed information.
- Inquire About Code: Allow users to ask Gemini about specific files or sections of the codebase to aid in understanding.
- PR Review: Use Gemini as a tool to analyze open pull requests, highlighting key changes and potential conflicts.
- Solution Planning: Leverage Gemini as a tool to propose solution plans for open issues in the repository.
- Readme Generation: Use Gemini to generate README files for user codebases based on project files and comments.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to evoke intelligence and sophistication.
- Background color: Dark purple (#210F37), a very desaturated form of the primary color to provide a calm, non-distracting backdrop.
- Accent color: Light aqua (#CDF5FD), slightly brighter and more saturated than the primary, to highlight interactive elements and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Noto Sans' sans-serif for a clear and modern reading experience.
- Code font: 'Fira Code' monospaced, to make source code clear.
- Use simple, outlined icons to represent file types, actions, and feedback.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide a smooth user experience when loading and displaying summarized content.
