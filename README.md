# Gistify

**Gistify** is an intelligent code summarization tool designed to help developers quickly understand and contribute to any public GitHub repository. Powered by **Gemini**, Gistify analyzes documentation, source code, and repository structure to generate a high-level understanding and visual architecture of a codebase—so you don’t have to read every line yourself.

## 🚀 Features

* **High-Level Repository Summaries**
  Get a concise overview of any public GitHub repo, including documentation insights, file structure, and code abstractions.

* **Interactive Abstraction Graphs**
  Visualize how components relate to one another in the codebase. Drill down from high-level modules to low-level details with ease.

* **Codebase Querying**
  Ask Gemini natural language questions about specific files or code sections to clarify functionality and logic.

* **Pull Request Review Assistant**
  Let Gistify summarize, review, and suggest improvements for open PRs.

* **Issue-Solving Assistant**
  Generate potential solution plans and architectural suggestions for open issues.

* **Automated High-Level Design Docs**
  Produce detailed system design documents for repositories that warrant architectural overviews.

* **README Generator**
  Automatically generate clear, professional README files for your own repositories.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Analyze Documentation**: Gistify first reads any existing README, contributing guides, or design docs.
2. **Understand the Code**: It then parses the codebase to identify key abstractions, modules, and data flow.
3. **Generate Summary + Graph**: Based on the findings, Gistify creates a human-readable summary and an abstraction graph.
4. **Enable Deep Dives**: Users can click into parts of the graph to explore specific components or ask questions via Gemini.
5. **Collaborate and Extend**: Use Gistify to review PRs, address issues, or generate supporting documentation.

## 📸 Example Use Cases

* **New contributor?** Understand a complex codebase in minutes instead of hours or days.
* **Maintainer?** Save time onboarding new team members or reviewing external PRs.
* **Open Source Dev?** Generate instant READMEs and architectural docs for your project.
* **Hackathon?** Quickly identify how to build on top of someone else’s project.

## 🔍 Future Roadmap

* Support for **private repositories**
* Integration with **CI/CD pipelines** for auto-generated summaries on merge
* Custom abstraction graph editing
* Export formats (PDF, Markdown, Mermaid.js diagrams)
